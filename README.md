# Flask Blog Web Application

The code below represents my inaugural **Flask** project, which serves as a blog website allowing users to publish their blogs and articles.
The web application encompasses both `frontend` and `backend` functionality.

## Website flow

 1. Signup and validate your email
 2. Login to your Account
 3. If forgot password, password reset email will be sent with the link
 4. Write and publish the blog
 5. Update or delete the blog

In addition to these core features, the web application offers several supplementary functionalities. Users can engage in discussions through blog comments, create and customize their user profiles, and conveniently filter blog content according to specific users or criteria.
